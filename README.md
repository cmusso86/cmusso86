### Bem-vindo! Bienvenido! Welcome! Bienvenue!

I am a biologist and aspiring statistitian. I am in the verge of graduating and this page contains mostly the "homeworks" I had to complete during my studies. You will find some material about Temporal Series, Demography, Computational Statistics.

I am currently interested in Neural Networks and Causal Inference, although I dont know much about neither. 

Anyways, I hope you find something useful around here.
