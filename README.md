### Bem-vindo! Bienvenido! Welcome! Bienvenue!

I am a biologist and aspiring statistitian, currently on the verge of graduating. This page primarily showcases the academic assignments and projects I have undertaken during my studies, among some other trivialities.  You'll come across various materials related to topics such as Temporal Series, Demography, and Computational Statistics. Almost all content (or exacly all af them) was developed in R within RStudio, (probably) because I am an incorrigible R-enthusiast and RStudio advocate.

My current areas of interest lie in Neural Networks and Causal Inference, even though my knowledge in both areas is still very limited o.O. 

Regardless of your specific interests, I hope you'll discover something valuable within the content presented here. (And Yes, chatGPT did help me writing this info).
